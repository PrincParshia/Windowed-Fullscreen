## 📗 DESCRIPTION

Windowed Fullscreen is a mod that allows you to hide the window title bar and access your taskbar/panel while in fullscreen mode. It’s perfect for players who want a cleaner fullscreen experience without losing the convenience of interacting with other system elements. This feature also known as Borderless Windowed or Borderless Fullscreen.

## ✨ KEY FEATURES

* **Windowed Fullscreen;** Maximizes the window to the monitor and hides the system taskbar when the window is focused (even if the taskbar is set to be always visible).

* **Borderless Windowed;** Maximizes the window to the available screen space. Similar to standard window maximization, but with a borderless appearance.
